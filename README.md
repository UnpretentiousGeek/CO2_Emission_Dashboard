### Interactive visualization dashboard in Python with Panel

This repo contains code for the portfolio project on CO2 Emission. I did it with the help of [Thu Vu](https://www.youtube.com/c/Thuvu5/featured).

If you want to see all the dependencies for this project, please see [requirements.txt](https://github.com/thu-vu92/python-dashboard-panel/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.

To serve the dashboard locally, use the command:
```
panel serve Interactive_dashboard.ipynb
```
